# terravizion
TerraVizion is an advanced terrarium(or garden, flower and other...) monitoring and management system designed for Raspberry Pi. This project combines environmental data collection, timelapse creation, and a comprehensive web-based management interface to provide a complete solution for terrarium enthusiasts.

Features
Environmental Data Collection: Continuously monitor and record temperature, humidity, and other environmental parameters.
Timelapse Creation: Automatically capture images at specified intervals and generate timelapse videos to observe changes over time.
Web-Based Interface: Manage all aspects of the system through an intuitive web interface built with Django.
Dashboard: View real-time data and visualizations of environmental conditions.
Camera Control: Adjust camera settings and capture intervals directly from the web interface.
System Management: Perform system operations such as rebooting, shutting down, and managing storage devices.
API Integration: Extend functionality with a robust API for external integrations.
Automated Setup: Deploy a fully configured system using a pre-built Raspberry Pi image, ensuring quick and easy setup.
Getting Started
Prepare Your Raspberry Pi: Ensure you have a Raspberry Pi with an SD card.
Flash the Image: Download the pre-built image and flash it to your SD card using a tool like Etcher.
Boot Up: Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it on.
Access the Web Interface: Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi to access the TerraVision interface.
Prerequisites
Raspberry Pi with an SD card
Etcher for flashing the image
Network connection for accessing the web interface
Installation
